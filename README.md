# Student Performance

**Analysis of Student Performance**

An examination or test is a type of educational assessment that is used to assess a test-knowledge, taker's skill, aptitude, physical fitness, or classification in a variety of subjects. A test can be given verbally, on paper, on a computer, or in a specific location that requires the test taker to demonstrate or perform a set of skills.

In this repository, I will be analyzing the student's performance across math, writing, and reading scores. Other than that, I am also analyzing whether there is a correlation between parents' level of education and the number of students who passed the exams.
